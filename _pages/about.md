Welcome to my website!
My name is Jonathan Ji, and I am a third-year undergrad studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. 

I am currently undegrad researcher at the Space Science Laboratory, writing embedded software for the [Background Transisent Observer on Nasa's COSI](https://cosi.ssl.berkeley.edu/bto/) satellite. Previously, I was the Electrical Lead for [CALSOL](https://calsol.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley's Solar Vehicle Racing Team, and have extensive experience with designing PCBs and surviving integration hell. 
This semester I'm exploring digital design (ASICs), analog IC design, post-silicon verification, and domain acceleration research!

Outside of classes I enjoy playing soccer, playing the bass guitar, and learning how to DJ.
