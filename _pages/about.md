Welcome! 
My name is Jonathan Ji. I am a rising third-year undergrad studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I love everything to do with electricity! I am currently interested in exploring computer architecture, digital/analog design, and cyber-physical systems.

I am currently undegrad researcher at the Space Science Laboratory, writing embedded software for the [Background Transisent Observer on Nasa's COSI](https://cosi.ssl.berkeley.edu/bto/) satellite. I was also the Electrical Lead for [CALSOL](https://calsol.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley's Solar Vehicle Racing Team, and have extensive experience with designing PCBs and surviving integration hell. 

Fun facts: I lived in Shanghai for 17 years. I play both the electric and bass guitar. I also love cats!
